I was looking for a way to produce call-tree in VIM. The CCTree[1] is good, but sometimes you just want a graph. After some googling I found this callgraphviz[2] and calltree.sh[3] altogether is just what I want. I have forked the callgraphviz[2] and add whatever is needed to work for my environment.

callgraphviz is not currently used in the calltree.sh.

INSTALL:
    1. Copy the calltree.sh to anywhere shell would look for, e.g. /usr/bin
    2. Copy the calltree.vim to ~/.vim/plugin

In VIM with cscope, press the following function on a keyword would:
<F2>: produce a 1-level Callee graph by xdot
<F3>: produce a 1-level Caller graph by xdot

My environment:
    * Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS
    * vim-2:7.4.052-1ubuntu3
    * cscope-15.8a-2
    * graphviz-2.36.0-0ubuntu3.1

TODO:
    * callgraphviz fix save to .dot issue
    * callgraphviz delete symbol
    * callgraphviz function expand and collapse caller/callee function
    * calltree.sh use callgraphviz
